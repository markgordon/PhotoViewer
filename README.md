# PhotoViewer

Uses opencv on raspberry pi (linux) to create a randomized slideshow from all sub-directories in the root of the file path. The keyboard
logic works OK, sometimes seems to ignore input. Used instead of the slim pickings for commercial offerings to enable better screens, better randomization and unlimited directories and files.

Requires:

- Opencv
- QTCreator if you want to use the build files, though they really aren't necessary/may hinder you.
- C++17 or get filesystem stuff from boost, which I didn't feel like dragging around.

This is unmaintained.
