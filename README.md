# PhotoViewer

Uses opencv on raspberry pi (linux, I guess Windows should work, too, but I haven't tried it.) to create a randomized slideshow from all sub-directories in the root of the file path. The keyboard
logic works OK, sometimes seems to ignore input. Used instead of the slim pickings for commercial offerings to enable better screens, better randomization and unlimited directories and files.

If you have an old hard drive lying around you can take the Rpi to with the drive to the back of a monitor mounted on a wall and it actually has a pretty clean look. Monitors are pretty thick anyway so it never looks greate unless it is inset.

Requires:

- Opencv
- QTCreator if you want to use the build files, though they really aren't necessary/may hinder you.
- C++17 or get filesystem stuff from boost, which I didn't feel like dragging around.

This is unmaintained.
